#
# This graphics driver is functional and has reasonable performance on modest
# hardware such as a PyBadge. Presently it provides enough functionality to
# support the desired background colour and the DrawImage trait.
#
# LIMITATION: DISPLAY
#
# Currently, this driver will only work on controllers with built-in displays
# as the board.DISPLAY variable is used.
#
# LIMITATION: HIERARCHY
#
# There is one notable limitation of this driver versus the Pygame zero driver
# that it is important to be aware of and it is related to how the TileGrid
# instances which are used to contain the graphics are constructed. When the
# game is initialise (init() is called) we traverse the entire hierarchy (all
# active AND inactive GameObjects) and generate the TileGrid instances. These
# are all added to the object Group instance. Because we add them in the order
# that we traverse the hierarchy, the implicit draw order is preserved - even
# with the deactivated objects. We also only generate the TileGrid instances
# we need. See the note below about why we don't minic the hierarchy structure.
#
# However, if the hierarchy later changes, we do not rebuild the order of the
# TileGrid instances. New GameObjects will get added to the end of the list in
# the order they are process. Further, if the parent and child relationships are
# changed for existing objects, the TileGrid order is NOT changed to reflect this.
#
# The way to work around this is straightforward.
#  * Ensure you entire hierarchy is consistent from the start and when adding
#    new branches to the hierarchy, do it in a way that works additively (i.e.
#    add the entire new branch to the Game.root instance).
#  * If you need to rework the hierarchy, call Graphics.game_object_hierarchy_changed()
#    which will force a rebuild of the entire hierarchy. This is expensive so
#    use it sparingly and at points that can accomodate the performance hit.
#
# Destroyed objects always get removed correctly. Deactivated objects get correctly
# hidden.
#
# Why don't we mimic the hierarchy structure?
#
# Some GameObjects can have multiple TileGrid instances and some GameObjects will
# have none. We could in theory place a single Group instance on each GameObject
# in the hierarchy and attach the TileGrids to those and connect up the Groups in
# the hierarchy. Whilst a definite potential improvement, it does come with an
# extra memory requirement and unfortunately, doesn't address all issues. This is
# because under normal operation the draw() function only cycles over enabled
# objects, so if a mix of disabled and enabled objects are added, then the draw
# order won't be correct. therefore, the lower memory cost and faster performance
# option was taken.
