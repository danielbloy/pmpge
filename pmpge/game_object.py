class GameObject:
    """
    GameObject is the base class for all objects in the game. It provides a simple parent/child
    structure for updating and drawing GameObjects as well as a simple way to manage active and
    visible states.

    A GameObject has the following built-in properties:
        * name: The name of this object. Used when locating an object by name. Must not contain the
                `/` or `.` characters.
        * active: This has to be True for the GameObject to be updated or drawn (visible and
                  enabled also need to be True). The value of active is propagated to all children.
                  Changing active will also trigger the corresponding handlers.
        * alive: If this is False, the object will be removed from its parent at the next update.
                 Can only be set to False by calling destroy(). When set to False, the corresponding
                 handlers will be triggered and destroy will be propagated to all children.
        * enabled: If this is True and active is also True, the object will be updated. This is not
                   propagated to children. Enabled only ever impacts this GameObject, even during
                   updates (i.e. updates are still propagated to children even if this is False).
        * visible: If this is True and active is also True, the object will be drawn. This is not
                   propagated to children.
        * parent: The parent GameObject. This is None if the GameObject has no parent. A GameObject
                  can only have one parent. It is an error to add a GameObject as a child to
                  multiple parents.
        * children: A list of child GameObjects. These will be updated and drawn only if this
                    GameObject is active.

    A GameObject also provides a set of events that can have handlers attached to them. The handlers
    can be used to provide instance-specific behaviour without having to make a subclass and
    override one of the `draw()`, `update()`, `activate()`, `deactivate()` or destroyed() methods.
    These handlers are also used with Traits (see later).
        * draw_handlers: Draw handlers are called during `draw_hierarchy()` if the GameObject is
          active and visible.
        * update_handlers: Update handlers are called during `update_hierarchy()` if the GameObject
          is active and enabled.
        * activate_handlers = Activate handlers are called when active changes from False to True.
        * deactivate_handlers = Deactivate handlers are called when active changes from True to
          False.
        * destroy_handlers = Destroy handlers are called when `destroy()` is called on the
          GameObject.

    The `update_hierarchy()` and `draw_hierarchy()` functions propagate down the hierarchy if
    active is True and regardless of the visible and active properties (which only apply to this
    GameObject instance). i.e. a child can be enabled or visible even if the parent is not.

    Destroy, activate and deactivate are propagated to all children irrespective of whether
    active is True or False. All handlers are called before passing to the children except for
    destroy which propagates to the children first.

    The `draw()`, `update()`, `activate()`, `deactivate()` and destroyed() methods are called before
    any handlers.

    GameObjects can also have traits applied to them. Traits are a kind of Mixin and used as a way
    to apply behaviour to a GameObject without subclassing. Traits make use of the handlers. When a
    trait is "applied" to a GameObject, all variables are copied from the trait instance to the
    GameObject and if any of the following methods are present on the trait instance, they are copied
    across to the relevant handler too. This mechanism allows traits to depend on other traits and
    access the same state. Methods that are attached to the GameObjects handlers:
        * draw()
        * update()
        * activated()
        * deactivated()
        * destroyed()

    When a trait is "applied", it will have either the `activated()` or `deactivated()` method called
    based on the state of the GameObject. Finally, if a `merged()` method is present on the trait,
    that will be called.

    Traits are not a complete replacement for subclassing because the entire object is not copied across.
    For example, methods, property getter and setter methods. For an example of a subclass using traits,
    see the Sprite class.
