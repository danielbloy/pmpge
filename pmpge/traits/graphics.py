    image). Optionally, this can be drawn using the x, y position as the top left corner
    by setting centered = False.

    The DrawImage trait requires a graphics specific implementation called
    GraphicsDrawImageTrait which does the actual drawing (and therefore needs to
    provide at least a `draw()`) method. It should use the `offset_x` and `offset_y`
    properties (which are placed on `image`) to adjust the position of the drawn
    image relative to the GameObjects x and y position.
